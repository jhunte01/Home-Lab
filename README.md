Within a virtual environment, I have configured a Windows 2019 Active Directory Domain Controller server. On this server, I utilized Bad Blood from secframe to create an organizational environment of 2500 users, 500 groups, and 100 computers with random security misconfigurations. The main task is to correct these misconfigurations and create a more secure environment that would be seen at the small enterprise level using the plan laid out by sec frame here (https://secframe.com/docs/ramp/what_is_redforest/)
